# Viswanathan Research Group

Website built using (and grateful to) [this template](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web), of which this is no longer a fork so that we can have our own issues and pull requests. See bottom of this file for licensing info, etc.

This README is a slightly modified, compressed, and reorganized version of the original from the template.
