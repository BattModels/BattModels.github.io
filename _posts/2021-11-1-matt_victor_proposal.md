Congrats to Matt Guttenberg and Victor Venturi for their successful research proposals! 
Matt is doing his PhD thesis on complexity science for electric vehicle modeling and infrastructure optimization while Victor is doing his PhD thesis on solid-solid interfaces in lithium-ion batteries. Both are on track to defend their thesis by the end of the Spring 2022 semester.
