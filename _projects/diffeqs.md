title: Accelerated solution of microkinetic differential equations

description: |
  Leveraging the advanced numerical techniques implemented in the Julia programming language, we are developing customized solutions to dramatically speed up the solutions of the challenging stiff differential algebraic equations (DAEâ€™s) that describe the interactions of chemical species on catalytic surfaces.
