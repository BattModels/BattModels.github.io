title: Sequential learning for design of experiments

description: |
    We will perform physics-aware machine learning to iteratively guide simulations towards candidate materials. This sequential learning approach will enable an efficient and uncertainty-driven exploration of the high-dimensional design spaces encompassed in this work while allowing for multi-objective optimization of catalyst parameters.
