- Batteries that can achieve performance metrics (power and energy density, safety, cyclability, etc.) appropriate to long-range driving, trucking, and eventually flight 
- Catalysts to improve fuel cells and enable electrification of chemical industry such as fertilizer (ammonia) production 
- Closed-loop materials discovery paradigms encompassing first-principles simulation, machine learning, automated experimentation, and design space search to drastically accelerate identification of new battery electrolytes, catalysts, etc.
