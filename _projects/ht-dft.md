title: High-throughput density functional theory calculations

description: |
  To rapidly generate a large-scale database of reaction intermediate structures, we are developing an automated DFT framework. This will simultaneously accelerate adsorption energy computations while systematically accumulating and manipulating output data in a manner for ease of integration into machine learning models. Moreover, it will facilitate the overall closed-loop sequential learning approach to explore new systems.
