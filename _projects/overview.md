description: |
  This project involves software development efforts for accelerated solution of differential and algebraic equations describing the kinetics of the electrochemical systems, integration of these solvers with machine learning approaches, and global optimization over the chemical design space.  The high-value candidates will be tested experimentally, validating the entire approach.
