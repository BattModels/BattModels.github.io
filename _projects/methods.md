We have a strong commitment to using and contributing to open-source software development efforts. We're always learning more, but the current methods/tools most commonly used in the group are summarized here."

Our group is primarily computational/theoretical, with a small but growing experimental presence in collaboration with Prof. Jay Whitacre, focused on integrating machine learning approaches with automated experimentation. We have a strong commitment to using and contributing to open-source software development efforts. We're always learning more, but the current methods/tools most commonly used in the group are summarized here.

  - Electronic structure calculations: Density Functional Theory using [GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/) and the [Atomic Simulation Environment (
ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
  - [Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai) in both [Julia](https://julialang.org) and Python
  - Phase-field modeling: [MOOSE](https://www.mooseframework.org)
  - Crystal structure search/prediction: <a href="http://calypso.cn" data-proofer-ignore>CALYPSO</a>
  - Bayesian optimization with [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly-opt.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
  - Nearly all of the above rely on high-performance computing resources on the shared College of Engineering Cluster mananged by our group, Arjuna, as
 well as at national leadership computing facilities such as NERSC and XSEDE
