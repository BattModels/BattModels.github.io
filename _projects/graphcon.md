title: Graph convolutional methods for molecules and surfaces

description: |
  Building on the success of Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks in predicting properties of crystalline solids as well as software packages for molecular machine learning such as DeepChem (for which we are developing the official Julia language port), we are developing software to combine these techniques to rapidly and accurately predict energetics of the adsorption processes critical to catalysis of reactions such as nitrogen reduction.
